# Professional README Generator Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to introduce us to Node.js and the world of back-end development. We are required to create a ReadMe file through a code that takes input data from the command line and outputs it in the form of a ReadMe.

- First major hurdle was figuring out how to get started. I felt like I knew nothing all over again. Rereading through the module and referring to the module code certainly helped here.
- I must give credit to GitHub user jpd61 for providing me a very similar project as a reference.  I studied his code to understand why and how certain syntax works, and applied them to my assignment wherever I deemed necessary. I would only apply code after I fully understood the meaning of its application.
