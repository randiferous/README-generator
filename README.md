# Professional README Generator Challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to introduce us to Node.js and the world of back-end development. We were required to create a README file through JavaScript code that takes input data from the command line and outputs it in the form of a ReadMe. In order to complete this project, it was necessary to understand Node APIs and the Node Package Manager. From these, we needed to use the file system module and the inquirer package, both of which we had to install through the command line. For this challenge, we also had to use unfamiliar JavaScript syntax, known as ES6.

The first major hurdle of this assignment was figuring out how to get started. Honestly, it felt like I knew nothing all over again. Whereas all previous challenges resulted in a webpage browser and required HTML/CSS, this challenge had nothing to do with a browser and only required the JavaScript file and the command line. Furthermore, I am still unfamiliar with ES6, so trying to use its syntax almost felt like a new language to me. To help myself out, I made sure to reread through module 9 material and refer to the module code to get an idea of the pieces I need.

The initial step of setting up the prompt and testing its questions and answer outputs from the command line was relatively straightforward, as you can figure out the syntax from the [inquirer package documentation](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#readme). Next, I moved onto setting up the ReadMe file format, for which I referred to the [GitHub documentation on ReadMe files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Here, it is important to realize that the two files index.js and generateMarkdown.js are linked by the "module.exports" and "require" expressions. This means we can interpolate variables from the user input into the template literal of the README generator. Then, I created a function that would create the README and completed the work with a Promise code.

A few noteworthy technical hurdles to mention are as follows:
- making sure the license badges appeared properly, which meant creating an appropriate image URL without an extra dash or space;
- deciding which portions of the starter code I needed to use or not (for instance, the provision of a question array was not necessary, although it could be used by others for a cleaner looking code);
- ensuring I have the proper "require" variables in place so that I can use an external module/package.
